# 🕒 Digital Clock Projects

This repository contains my practice projects for building digital clocks using C++. I’m incrementally improving the clock's functionality as I learn and grow as a developer.

---

## 📌 Project Goal

- Build a functional digital clock from scratch using C++.
- Add new features incrementally to improve usability and complexity.
- Practice clean code, modularity, and documentation.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Tools:** Standard Template Library (STL), `<chrono>`, `<thread>`, `<iomanip>`, etc.

## 📦 Versions

| Version | Features Included                    | File Link                            |
|---------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| v1      | Basic digital clock (HH:MM:SS)       | [v1_digital_clock.cpp](v1_digital_clock.cpp) |
<!-- | v2      | Added current date (DD/MM/YYYY)      | [v2_with_date.cpp](v2_with_date.cpp) |
| v3      | Added day of the week (e.g., Mon)    | [v3_with_day_of_week.cpp](v3_with_day_of_week.cpp) |
| v4      | 12/24 Hour toggle option             | [v4_12_24_toggle.cpp](v4_12_24_toggle.cpp) | -->

## 🖥️ Demo (Optional)

_Add a gif or screenshot of the running clock here (later)._

## 📚 Learning Milestones

- `std::chrono` for working with time.
- `std::this_thread::sleep_for()` for real-time updates.
- Date/time formatting with `std::put_time()`.
- Conditionals and modular version control.
- Clean structuring and feature updates.

---

## 🧠 Upcoming Improvements

- Add alarm functionality.  
- Make a GUI version using a library like SFML or Qt (stretch goal).  
- Add timezone support.  
- Package and document as a C++ utility module.
